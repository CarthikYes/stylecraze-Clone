## Challenges

1. I faced a lot of issues in cloning this website. The first challenge I faced was I didn’t have any data for the website so I had to create data on my own for different categories of products.
2. Dimension cloning and responsiveness was another challenge that I faced.
3. The last and most Challenging was merging all the pages because at some places I used the same classes and id’s so it was quite difficult to arrange them in a proper way.
